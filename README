------------------
  ONE-TIME SETUP
------------------
Run the setup script to fetch the following tools, libraries, and prepare all javascript
files needed by Termite. This script only needs to be run once when Termite is first
downloaded onto a new machine.
    >> ./setup.sh

Libraries fetched include:
    * MALLET
    * STMT
    * Closure compiler
    * YUI compressor
    * d3.js
    * jquery.js
    * underscore.js
    * backbone.js

The script creates a minified version of all javascript files.

-----------------------
  BUILD A TOPIC MODEL
-----------------------
Building a topic model in Termite requires running a single python script. The script reads
in an input text corpus, and produces an output folder whose content can be inspected 
using a web browser, described in the next section.

To process a text corpus, and build a topic model by running one of the following scripts.
Execution time will vary depending on the size of the corpus.
    >> src/import_file.sh
    >> src/import_folder.sh

---------------------------- 
  VIEW TOPIC MODEL OUTPUTS
----------------------------
You are now ready to visualize the topic model outputs! Termite's output can be viewed in
a web browser. To view the files locally (on your own computer), you need to set up a local
web server.

Start a local server by running
    >> ./web.sh

Open http://localhost:8888/client_src in a modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Opera)
to view a visualization of the model outputs.

-----------------------------
  TOPIC MODEL VISUALIZATION
-----------------------------
The visualization should consist of a matrix view with a frequency bar view to the right.
The top right contains user controls, two slider bars and one input text box. User
controls are explained in more detail in the 'VISUALIZATION USE CASES' section.

When the mouse is placed over terms, topics, circles, or bars in the matrix or frequency 
bar view, the associated term, topic, bar, and circles will be highlighted in both views.

-------------------
  EXAMPLE DATASET
-------------------
To download the "20 newsgroup" example dataset, execute the following command
    >> ./setup.sh data

And then execute the following script
    >> src/import_folder.sh corpus/20newsgroups 20newsgroups
